This folder is made of simple projects.

1. simpleFFT_mnist-(Signals and Systems)
This is a model that distinguishs single digit (0~9).
Using audiomnist to trainset and sklearn LSTM to train.
I use only 3000 frequencies and magnitudes because of time limit.
I just want to know FFT can be used to distinguish audio sounds.

2. Compressed sensing (Linear algebra)
Compressed sensing is the way to find answer to using sparsity of X.
A means Measurement matrix, y means Observation, K means Sparsity.
The project problem is that express the real picture that is mess with the noise.

3. App - timetogo (techno management)
This is a app that user can set alarm more user friendly. It was hard to set a departure time to go, so we give not only target alarm but also departure time.
this file is just prototype to show how app works.

4. Water-spray-bot
In seoul robot academy program, our team made water_spray_bot. We use Labview in Lattepanda. This is the report about my part, programming.
