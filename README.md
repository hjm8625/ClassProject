This folder is made of simple projects that I did in the university class.

1. simpleFFT_mnist-(Signals and Systems)
This is a model that distinguishs single digit (0~9).
Using audiomnist to trainset and sklearn LSTM to train.
I use only 3000 frequencies and magnitudes because of time limit.
I just want to know FFT can be used to distinguish audio sounds.

2. Compressed sensing (Linear algebra)
Compressed sensing is the way to find answer to using sparsity of X.
A means Measurement matrix, y means Observation, K means Sparsity.
The project problem is that express the real picture that is mess with the noise.
